Why is builder required?

    - Some objects are simple and are created in a single initializer call
    
    - Some objects require a lot of ceremony to be created
    
    - Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
    
    - We opt for piecewise object constructed: the builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
    
    - When piecewise object construction is complicated, builder provides an API for doing it succintly
